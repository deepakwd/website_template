                           Third generation of computer used in IC() developed the jack kelby concept of IC in 1948. it was an important invention in the computer field in the first IC was invented it used in 1961. The size of iC was about 1/4 squire. inch. The singal ic chjip makes contain 1000 of transister.

                            the computer become smaller in size faster more relievable and less.
                               <strong>example: </strong> IBM-370, IBM-system 1360, UNIVAC-1108,UNIVAC AC-9000,etc.
